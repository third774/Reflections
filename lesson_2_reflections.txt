What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates the framework for the metadata to be tracked. Once that is complete, you can make your first commit!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where you can define which items should be added to the next commit, whereas the working directory shows everything as it is.
